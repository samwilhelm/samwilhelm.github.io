I am a 3rd-year PhD student at the University of Tennessee studying community ecology, plant-pollinator interactions, and the natural history of native bee and plant communities. My research prioritizes the conservation of the North American native bee fauna- a fascinating group of organisms that has been historically overlooked for their diversity and invaluable role in pollinating both wild and agricultural flowering plants.

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, reading, and photography. My newest obsession is documenting in situ the plant-bee interactions I study via macrophotography. Many of these can be seen on my [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/samwilhelm) page.
