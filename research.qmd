I study plant-pollinator interactions and community assembly in several systems: My dissertation is focused on central TN cedar glades. These glades are calcareous rock outcroppings that occur in a matrix of deciduous broad leaf and eastern red cedar forests. They are habitat to a unique assemblage of endemic and rare plants. My research is the first to document the associated bee communities of these plants. My team and I have hand-netted over 3,500 specimens representing 5 families and 100+ species of native bees.

I also examine the effects of controlled burning and other restoration techniques on plant and pollinator communities. I have conducted research on mixed-grass prairies of Texas and Oklahoma and in pine savannas of the central TN hardwoods region.
