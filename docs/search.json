    "text": "I study plant-pollinator interactions and community assembly in several systems: My dissertation is focused on central TN cedar glades. These glades are calcareous rock outcroppings that occur in a matrix of deciduous broad leaf and eastern red cedar forests. They are habitat to a unique assemblage of endemic and rare plants. My research is the first to document the associated bee communities of these plants. My team and I have hand-netted over 3,500 specimens representing 5 families and 100+ species of native bees.\nI also examine the effects of controlled burning and other restoration techniques on plant and pollinator communities. I have conducted research on mixed-grass prairies of Texas and Oklahoma and in pine savannas of the central TN hardwoods region.\nFunding\nFall 2024 - Spring 2027 - NSF Graduate Research Fellowship"

    "text": "I am a 3rd-year PhD student at the University of Tennessee studying community ecology, plant-pollinator interactions, and the natural history of native bee and plant communities. My research prioritizes the conservation of the North American native bee fauna- a fascinating group of organisms that has been historically overlooked for their diversity and invaluable role in pollinating both wild and agricultural flowering plants.\nOutside of research, I enjoy hiking, reading, and photography. My newest obsession is documenting in situ the plant-bee interactions I study via macrophotography. Many of these can be seen on my iNaturalist page.\n\n\n\nColletes robertsonii - A specialist on Dalea gattingeri in TN cedar glades."
